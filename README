apt-metalink
============

apt-metalink allows you to download deb packages from several sources
concurrently and makes upgrade process faster -- if you have fast
internet connection ;)
apt-metalink uses python-apt to interface apt infrastructure.

Prerequisites
-------------

apt-metalink uses aria2 as downloader.
You can install aria2 using:

    apt-get install aria2

I strongly recommend to use the latest release of aria2. The latest
version of aria2 is 1.10.3 at the time of writing.
You can download aria2 from http://aria2.sourceforge.net/

Edit sources.list
-----------------

sources.list is ususally located at /etc/apt/sources.list.  Add
several fast debian mirror server to it.  Don't add slow mirror. It
voids the power of apt-metalink.  For example, adding 3 debian mirror:

  deb http://MIRROR1/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
  deb http://MIRROR2/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
  deb http://MIRROR3/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

See sources.list(5) for more details.

apt-metalink uses them all and download packages concurrently, which
makes faster download.

Currently, apt-metalink passes the number of mirrors as -j option to
aria2c.

Usage
-----

  Usage: apt-metalink [options] {upgrade | dist-upgrade | install pkg ...}

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -x ARIA2C, --aria2c=ARIA2C
                          path to aria2c executable [default: /usr/bin/aria2c]

Currently, apt-metalink offers very basic subset of features that
apt-get has. But I think this is enough to see what apt-metalink
offers and its possibility.
